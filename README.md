## Overview
This assignment focuses on implementing, modifying, testing, and deploying an ERC-20 token smart contract using Solidity and Hardhat. The smart contract, originally developed in Assignment 3, Part 1, has been updated to accept an input parameter in its constructor, enhancing its flexibility and functionality. The assignment also includes writing comprehensive test cases to verify the correctness of the smart contract's operations and ensuring its successful deployment on the Sepolia Testnet.

## Prerequisites
- Remix IDE
- MetaMask Wallet
- VScode 


## ERC20 Token Implementation

### **1. Smart Contract Code**

Create a file **`MyToken.sol`** in Remix and paste the following Solidity code:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract UniversityToken is ERC20 {
    address public lastSender;
    address public lastReceiver;
    uint256 public lastTimestamp;

    constructor() ERC20("Ulzhan_Nurgul", "UN") {
        _mint(msg.sender, 2000 * 10**decimals());
    }

    function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) {
        lastSender = msg.sender;
        lastReceiver = recipient;
        lastTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        return super.transfer(recipient, amount);
    }

    function getLastTransactionTimestamp() public view returns (string memory) {
        return _formatTimestamp(lastTimestamp);
    }

    function getLastSender() public view returns (address) {
        return lastSender;
    }

    function getLastReceiver() public view returns (address) {
        return lastReceiver;
    }

    function _formatTimestamp(uint256 timestamp) internal pure returns (string memory) {
        uint256 SECONDS_PER_DAY = 86400;
        uint16 ORIGIN_YEAR = 1970;

        uint256 daysSinceEpoch = timestamp / SECONDS_PER_DAY;
        uint16 year = ORIGIN_YEAR;
        uint256 leapYears = (daysSinceEpoch + 1) / 1461; // Approximate leap year count
        year += uint16((daysSinceEpoch - leapYears) / 365);

        return uintToString(year);
    }
}

```

### **2. Compile the Contract**

- Open **Remix IDE** ‚Üí Select Solidity version **0.8.20**.
- Click **Compile MyToken.sol**.

### **3. Deploy the Contract**

- Go to **Deploy & Run Transactions**.
- Select **Injected Provider - MetaMask** (for Sepolia) or **Ganache Provider**.
- Click **Deploy** and confirm the transaction in MetaMask.

### **4. Interacting with the Contract**

After deploying, use Remix to interact with the contract:

#### **Check Token Balance**

```solidity
balanceOf("your_address")
```

#### **Transfer Tokens**

```solidity
transfer("receiver_address", amount)
```

#### **Retrieve Transaction Details**

- **Last Transaction Timestamp:** `getLastTransactionTimestamp()`
- **Last Sender Address:** `getLastSender()`
- **Last Receiver Address:** `getLastReceiver()`

![–û–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ –∏–∑–æ–±—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è](screens/transfer.png)

![–û–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ –∏–∑–æ–±—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è](screens/functions2.png)

![–û–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ –∏–∑–æ–±—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è](screens/functions3.png)

We can check that it's our ERC20 Token by calling these functions. Output shows the name, symbol and total supply as we provided in our smart contract.
## Set Up and Installation

### Setting up the environment
Installing Hardhat using the Node.js package manager (npm), which is both a package manager and an online repository for JavaScript code.
```bash
npm init -y
```

Initializing an npm project as shown below:
```bash
npm init
```

Now Hardhat can be installed:
```bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

In the same directory where you installed Hardhat run:
```bash
npx hardhat init
```

Selecting Create an empty hardhat.config.js from the the output:
```bash
$ npx hardhat init
888    888                      888 888               888

üë∑ Welcome to Hardhat v2.22.18 üë∑‚Äç

? What do you want to do? ‚Ä¶
  Create a JavaScript project
  Create a TypeScript project
  Create a TypeScript project (with Viem)
‚ùØ Create an empty hardhat.config.js
  Quit
```
When Hardhat is run, it searches for the closest hardhat.config.js file starting from the current working directory.

After writing down everything shown in src folder. We had results which shows that it is deployed:
![–û–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ –∏–∑–æ–±—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è](screens/alchemy.png)

![–û–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ –∏–∑–æ–±—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è](screens/MyTokenDeployed.png)

## Verify Deployment on Sepolia Explorer 
![–û–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ –∏–∑–æ–±—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è](screens/etherscan2.png)
![–û–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ –∏–∑–æ–±—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è](screens/etherscan.png)

As you can see we checked our account address on etherScan and we can see the all the tranasctions, activities there.

## Test Cases
First, we install testing dependencies:
```bash
npm install --save-dev chai ethers hardhat
```

We create a test file in the test/ folder:
```bash
mkdir test
touch test/universityToken.test.js
```
To ensure the contract works correctly, test cases were written using Hardhat.
We write tests using Chai (assertion library) and Hardhat's Ethers.js. Here you can see the test case before it was modified. In the test folder there is already modified version.
```bash
const { expect } = require("chai");
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

describe("UniversityToken", function () {
  let UniversityToken, universityToken, owner, addr1, addr2;

  beforeEach(async function () {
    [owner, addr1, addr2] = await ethers.getSigners();

    UniversityToken = await ethers.getContractFactory("UniversityToken");
    universityToken = await UniversityToken.deploy();
  });

  it("Should have correct name and symbol", async function () {
    expect(await universityToken.name()).to.equal("UniversityToken");
    expect(await universityToken.symbol()).to.equal("UT");
  });

  it("Should assign initial supply to owner", async function () {
    const ownerBalance = await universityToken.balanceOf(owner.address);
    expect(await universityToken.totalSupply()).to.equal(ownerBalance);
  });

  it("Should transfer tokens between accounts", async function () {
    await universityToken.transfer(addr1.address, 50);
    expect(await universityToken.balanceOf(addr1.address)).to.equal(50);
  });

  it("Should fail if sender doesn‚Äôt have enough balance", async function () {
    await expect(universityToken.connect(addr1).transfer(addr2.address, 100))
      .to.be.revertedWith("ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance");
  });

  it("Should approve and allow spending of tokens", async function () {
    await universityToken.approve(addr1.address, 100);
    expect(await universityToken.allowance(owner.address, addr1.address)).to.equal(100);
  });

  it("Should allow an approved address to transfer on behalf", async function () {
    await universityToken.approve(addr1.address, 100);
    await universityToken.connect(addr1).transferFrom(owner.address, addr2.address, 50);
    expect(await universityToken.balanceOf(addr2.address)).to.equal(50);
  });
});

To run the tests:
```bash
npx hardhat test
```


Output looked like this:
![–û–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ –∏–∑–æ–±—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è](screens/npx_test1.png)

For next test case we need to modify the smart contract:
```bash
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract UniversityToken is ERC20 {
    address public owner;

    constructor(address _owner) ERC20("UniversityToken", "UT") {
        owner = _owner;
        _mint(_owner, 2000 * 10 ** decimals()); // Mint initial supply to owner
    }
}
```
üîπ Key Changes:

- The constructor now takes _owner as a parameter.
- The owner state variable is initialized `with _owner`.
- The initial supply is minted `to _owner`

After that, executed Hardhat test suite again. Output looked like this:
![–û–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ –∏–∑–æ–±—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è](screens/npx_test2.png)

## Conclusion
In this assignment, we successfully developed and deployed an ERC-20 token (Ulzhan_Nurgul - UN) on the Sepolia Testnet using Solidity and Hardhat. The contract includes functions to track transaction details, such as the last sender, receiver, and timestamp.

We also verified the contract on Etherscan, allowing public interaction and transparency. This project provided hands-on experience with smart contract development, deployment, and blockchain interaction using Remix, Hardhat, MetaMask, and Web3.js.

This implementation serves as a strong foundation for understanding token standards and blockchain-based transactions.
